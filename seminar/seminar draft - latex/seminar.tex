\section{
  Cross Platform Applications
 }
A single codebase for multiple platforms.That is the idea behind cross platform applications.Usually when a company makes a software intended for a wider user range they need to make an android app, a web app and a desktop app just to get started.This is quite cumbersome since now you have multiple codebases of varying programming languages that needs to be maintained.

Cross platform applications solves this problem by using only a single codebase to represent the business logic.So now the duplication of code can be avoided and only one codebase need to be maintained which is cheaper and more efficient!They achieve this using cross platform application frameworks.
